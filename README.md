# Overview
Phase I of the improved library management system. This library management system is designed to allow librarians to store and manage digital representations of books in a library. This phase focused on implementing the functional requirements and logic of the program. The user interface and database implementation were out of scope for this phase. 

## Features
A pseudo database was used in place of an SQL database to focus on developing functionality. A console-based controller was used in place of a JavaFX controller. The user can print all books from the library's pseudo database. The user can add books from a text file of their choosing. The user can check in and check out books by typing a book's title into the console. The user can remove books from the library pseudo database.
